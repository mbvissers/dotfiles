# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for ease of transitioning to
other devices. Feel free to check them out, copy them, or modify them.

Dotfiles managed by [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow).

From the home directory `~`, run `stow <module>` where `module` is  folder nme in this repo. Stow should then place them in the correct path. 

VSCode is synced with the built-in sync via my GitHub account
